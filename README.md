Sometimes, you need to use icons in your project, but using a single library? Maybe too boring, using multiple? Well, works but can be a mess. So, we created Layrz Icons, a simple and easy to use icon library, designed to combine multiple libraries in a single one, also adding a mapping object to convert any `IconData` into a string.

## Live demo / search
You can check the icons and search for them on the [https://icons.layrz.com](https://icons.layrz.com)

Right now, `layrz_icons` integrates these libraries:
- [material_design_icons_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/material_design_icons_flutter)
