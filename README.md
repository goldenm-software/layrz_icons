# Layrz Icons

Managed by Golden M, Inc.

## Live demo / search
You can check the icons and search for them on the [https://icons.layrz.com](https://icons.layrz.com)

## Motivation
Sometimes, you need to use icons in your project, but using a single library? Maybe too boring, using multiple? Well, works but can be a mess. So, we created Layrz Icons, a simple and easy to use icon library, designed to combine multiple libraries in a single one, also adding a mapping object to convert any `IconData` into a string.

## Supported libraries
Right now, `layrz_icons` integrates three libraries:
- [material_design_icons_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/material_design_icons_flutter)
- [font_awesome_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/font_awesome_flutter)
- [solar_icons](https://pub.dev/packages/solar_icons)
- [ionicons](https://pub.dev/packages/ionicons)
- [iconsax_plus](https://pub.dev/packages/iconsax_plus)

Many thanks to the developers of these libraries, they are awesome!

## --no-tree-shake-icons is required? / Compilation failures
You need as mandatory to use the `--no-tree-shake-icons` flag in your Flutter project. Otherwise you will not be able to compile your app.

## Disclaimer
We don't attempt to copy or steal any icon, we just want to make it easier to use them in your projects. Also, if you want to add a new icon library, please make sure to check the license of the library, we don't want to have any legal issues.
